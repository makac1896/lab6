For this lab both partners worked together effectively and productively to complete this lab. We shared some of the initial modules
and one partner worked on the instruction register and decoder whilst the other setup the FSM controller. Afterwards, we then worked on writing testbenches
together for all the modules and ensuring that each of our modules was correct. After we had tested the individual modules,
we started testing each instruction and fixing errors in our datapath and CPU as necessary. This debugging process
was shared and allowed each partner to work on each part of the lab and gain a solid understanding of it. In the future,
it would have been beneficial to start using the lab6_check module earlier to spot errors in our cpu and subsequent testbenches.
We spent a significant amount of time debugging and we learned a lot from this process. In conclusion, both partners combined on each module of this lab
either through writing the initial implementation, testbenches or integration testing.
